# Stroke Risk Prediction ECG-based Using CNN-1D and Keras Tuner

## Objectives

1. **Stroke Prediction**: Develop a prediction/classification model capable of determining the likelihood of stroke in patients.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between electrocardiogram signals (ECG) and stroke occurrence.
3. **Clinical Solution**: Propose a clinical solution based on the analysis to contribute to advancing biomedical research.

## Methodology

- **Dataset**: The research utilizes a dataset focused on [Cerebral Vasoregulation in Elderly with Stroke](https://physionet.org/content/cves/1.0.0/data/24h-electromyography/#files-panel).
- **Modeling**: A One-Dimension Convolutional Neural Network (CNN-1D) is employed to analyze short-term ECG data.
- **Optimization**: The Keras Tuner technique is used to optimize the hyperparameters set for the model.
- **Classification**: The model is designed as a multi-layer binary classifier, distinguishing between stroke and non-stroke cases.
